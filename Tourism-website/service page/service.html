                    Tourism in Australia is an important part of the Australian economy, and comprises domestic and
                    international visitors. Australia is the fortieth most visited country in the world according to the
                    World Tourism Organization.[2] In the financial year 2018/19, tourism was Australia's fourth-largest
                    export and over the previous decade was growing faster than national GDP growth.[3] At the time it
                    represented 3.1% of Australia's GDP contributing A$60.8 billion to the national economy.[4]

                    The travel and tourism sector in the United Kingdom contributed GBP66.3 billion to the gross
                    domestic product (GDP), 3.4% of total GDP in 2016 and is expected to rise by 2.2% pa, from 2017 to
                    2027, to GBP84.6 billion, which could comprise up to 3.6% of the total GDP in 2027.[better source
                    needed].In 2011, visitors to London spent Â£9.4 billion, which is a little more than half of the
                    total amount international visitors spent in the whole of the United Kingdom the same year.

                    The contribution of travel and tourism to GDP was US$5,880.3bn (2.0% of total GDP) in 2016. Tourism
                    generated 556,135 jobs (2.5% of total employment) in 2016.[1] Foreign tourist visits were predicted
                    to have risen from 0.6 million in 2007 to 4 million in 2017.[2][3] Responsible tourism became a
                    peremptory need for Colombia because it minimizes negative social, economic and environmental
                    impacts and makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage.[4][5]
