                <p class="p-para">The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city
                    of Mumbai
                    (Bombay),
                    India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch
                    to
                    visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.The foundation stone was laid
                    in
                    March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century
                    Gujarati
                    architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in
                    1914,
                    and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26
                    metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati
                    architecture of the time.The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was
                    a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people
                    congregated at its premises following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel
                    opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.</p>

                <p class="p-para">The Taj Mahal [4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the
                    river Yamuna in
                    Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan
                    (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of
                    Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a
                    mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases
                    of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                    entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                    approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000
                    artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s court
                    architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and
                    divinity.</p>

                    Tourism in Australia is an important part of the Australian economy, and comprises domestic and
                    international visitors. Australia is the fortieth most visited country in the world according to the
                    World Tourism Organization.[2] In the financial year 2018/19, tourism was Australia's fourth-largest
                    export and over the previous decade was growing faster than national GDP growth.[3] At the time it
                    represented 3.1% of Australia's GDP contributing A$60.8 billion to the national economy.[4]

                    The travel and tourism sector in the United Kingdom contributed GBP66.3 billion to the gross
                    domestic product (GDP), 3.4% of total GDP in 2016 and is expected to rise by 2.2% pa, from 2017 to
                    2027, to GBP84.6 billion, which could comprise up to 3.6% of the total GDP in 2027.[better source
                    needed].In 2011, visitors to London spent £9.4 billion, which is a little more than half of the
                    total amount international visitors spent in the whole of the United Kingdom the same year.

                    The contribution of travel and tourism to GDP was US$5,880.3bn (2.0% of total GDP) in 2016. Tourism
                    generated 556,135 jobs (2.5% of total employment) in 2016.[1] Foreign tourist visits were predicted
                    to have risen from 0.6 million in 2007 to 4 million in 2017.[2][3] Responsible tourism became a
                    peremptory need for Colombia because it minimizes negative social, economic and environmental
                    impacts and makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage.[4][5]
